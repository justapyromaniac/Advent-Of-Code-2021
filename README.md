# Advent-of-code-2021

These are my solutions for the [2021 advent of code event](https://adventofcode.com/2021/).

I will post an isolated Java 17 project for each solution, since every solution can be written in any language.

I will also be creating one extra project which will contain all the previous solutions combined in one, this project will be solved specifically using OOP.

I'm using Java because that's what I started with and I'm too lazy to swap.
I started with Java because that's what I had open on my PC.
